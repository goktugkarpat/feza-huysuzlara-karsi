   Bütün simülasyon burada; DOM'a dokunmaz (UI'nin işi). Sözleşme: src/SPEC.md → "GAME".
   Extras beyond the SPEC: events 'happy' {type,x,z,elite,boss} and 'equip' {item,slot}; GAME.boss, GAME.time,
   GAME.unequip(slot), addItem(item), cast(i), hurtPlayer(n,x,z,kb), heal(frac). newGame() called in state 'end' (victory
   screen) starts NEW GAME+; newGame({plus:false}) forces a fresh start. GAME.update(dt) should run in every state except
   'title' (it drives the respawn timer, portal shrink and victory cheer); a timeout fallback respawns if it is not called.
   How hard the game is: the DIFF table below (measured with the kid bots in test/fix_src_07_game_js_balance.html; the
   dragon fight alone in test/fix_src_07_game_js_boss.html: its hp follows Feza's damage, and every nap tires it).
   loadZone() pre-compiles and draws everything the zone will show (warmZone) while the loading fade covers the screen.
   Feza's request: every sword is a LIGHTSABER (slash + hit sparks + Feza's light take ITEMS.bladeColor; the blade ignites
   with 'saberOn' at every zone start and respawn), the Köstebek burrows (kind 'burrow', st.burrow 0..1; untargetable while
   underground), the Salyangoz blows soap bubbles and leaves a slime trail, the dragon breathes bubbles and glitter.
   Round 3 (Feza: a volcano zone + a boss at the end of EVERY zone): one boss framework for all four (arena aggro, 'boss'
   event {on, name, type, final, hp, maxHp}, boss music, intro line, hp sized to Feza's damage per boss (DIFF.boss), naps
   tire the boss, checkpoint at the arena entrance). Kral Jöle hops + slams + spits jelly, Usta Köstebek burrows + pops up
   under Feza + throws dirt clods + drills, Koca Lav Kaplumbağası erupts lava balls onto circles + rolls along a lane +
   stomps; each summons little ones. A mid-zone boss cheering up drops treasure and opens the zone's portal (it is shut
   until then; an inactive portal does nothing); the dragon keeps the crystal finale. New creatures: kaplumbaga (tucks
   in and rolls at Feza along a lane), ateskusu (flying fire chick flicking slow embers). DIFF arrays are in ZONES order
   orman, magara, yanardag, kale (looked up by zone id). Saves before sv 3 with zone ≥ 2 move one zone on (castle = 3).
   Extra event 'portalOpen' {x, z}; 'happy' also carries final (true for the dragon). __T.boss(i) jumps to zone i's
   boss (default: the dragon), __T.bossHit(frac) / __T.bossCfg(type) testing aids.
   Round 3 QA fixes: a boss never sits inside Feza (separate() moves the boss when he cannot give way; hops / pop-ups land
   next to him); a portal that just opened does not swallow Feza standing on it (L.portalObj.openT / .armed: walk-in after
   PORTAL.wait s and once he was PORTAL.arm m away; a tap always works) and the boss's treasure flies to him (and into his
   pockets on entering); Kaydet after a mid-zone boss saves the NEXT zone, after the dragon flags.bossDone (crystal waits);
   a nap keeps the pack's progress (NAP); the arena checkpoint is just outside the arena; 'kapi' is skipped when the boss's
   happy line already says the door opened; a new skill's line waits for the boss story (skillQ).
   Tap-to-walk never runs in place: a net-progress watchdog (tapWalkProgress, PROG) swings at a vase in the way, else
   walks round once, else stands still (test/r3y_src_07_game_js_stuck.html).
   Round 4 (Feza: KEFİR VADİSİ, zone 1 right after the forest): DIFF arrays are in the 5-zone order orman, kefir, magara,
   yanardag, kale (ZORDER; looked up by zone id, so a 4-zone ZONES list still maps right). New creatures: yogurt hops at
   Feza and bumps (hopStep: crouch = st.windup, the hop = st.attack/st.air while GAME lifts the root along an arc, a
   circle shows where it lands), kaymak glides and dashes along a short lane leaving a creamy trail (rollStep with
   GLIDE numbers, FX 'slime' tinted cream), kopuk is a flying fizz-bubble shooter (shot kind 'fizz' floats and pops like a
   soap bubble), peynir is the slow heavy one (kind 'slam': a ground circle, cheese crumbs). Boss kefirdev (kefirdevStep):
   shake (wind-up, the foam cone shows) → geyser (a foam cone that pushes Feza out), bubbles (5 slow fizz bubbles in a
   fan), slam (hops and lands with a milk-splash ring), summons kopuk at 66 % / 33 %, a happy "fizz!" roar. When it cheers
   up it hands Feza a glass of kefir (GIFT: the glass flies to him, he puts the saber away, raises it, drinks — cheer pose,
   sparkles, full heal, 'kefirdev_bitti' → 'kefir_ikram' → 'kefirdev_yol'), then the treasure pops out, it waves goodbye
   and the portal opens (the 'happy' event carries beat = s until then and gift: true; extra event 'gift' {stage: 'drink' |
   'drunk', x, z, dur}). In the kefir zone the hearts are little kefir bottles and a cow moos far away now and then.
   'yolculuk' is said once after giris2; first-sight lines ilk_yogurt / ilk_kaymak / ilk_kopuk (≥ 5 s apart, a missed
   one comes at the next sighting). Saves are sv 4 and carry the zone id (zid): sv 3 with zone ≥ 1 moves one zone on
   (older ones first get the sv < 3 step). A checkpoint wake-up spot is always one Feza fits in, and a Feza pushed half
   into a wall steps out to the nearest free spot (a kid bot stood stuck in a castle corner for 100 s).
   Round 4 QA fixes: the voice waits its turn — first-sight lines (and the forest's name 'orman', now said at the first
   jelly / mushroom) start only when the narrator is free, FIRST_GAP s after the last one ENDED; 'yolculuk' comes at the
   first calm moment after giris2 (the owl first when Feza stands at it; the owl never queues behind other lines); the
   first skill's line waits for the intro; a skill won at a mid-zone boss is said in the next zone. The portal holds Feza
   while the cheered boss's story line plays (a tap waits in the swirl: C.portalHold); the Kefir Devi's portal wakes as
   'kefirdev_yol' reaches "Yol mağaradan geçiyor!", the giant waves until then and twirls away just before; the hand-over
   waits while Feza naps; no swings/skills while it hands him the glass (a Kasırga kept him whirling through the drink);
   the geyser's foam zone stays on the ground for the whole spray and its foam is a creamy fountain. The crystal waits for
   'ejderha_bitti'. Walking: routeTo walks to the best reachable spot near a finger on a bush / the milk; a drag that
   bounces in a wall corner re-routes (DRAGWIN); a ranged creature behind a wall comes round instead of backing off.
   Round 5 (Feza: SURLU ŞEHİR, the walled town before the dragon's castle = zone 4, the castle is now 5): DIFF arrays have
   six entries in ZORDER (orman, kefir, magara, yanardag, sehir, kale). Saves are sv 5; a save with a zid follows its id, one
   without keeps mapping its number through the Round 4 order (ZORDER4: an old castle save stays the castle). The town's
   grumpy people: nobetci (a spear poke, melee), simitci (throws simits: shot 'simit', ends in crumbs + a soft pop),
   supurgeci (glides along a lane like the kaymak, the broom whooshes and stirs up dust: DUSTY), tellal (HEAVY: the drum BOOM
   is a ground ring with music notes, 'drum'; the bell on his hat dings as he winds up). Boss sovalye (sovalyeStep, SOV;
   beats = 05's model timing contract): charge (a lane toward Feza's spot, 0–0.3 paws while the lane fills, 0.3–0.9 gallops
   to the arena rim bumping him at most once, 0.9–1 skids), rear (a ring fills 0–0.5, the stomp lands at 0.5), sweep (a wide
   lance cone fills 0–0.5, hit at 0.5), toss (3 silver horseshoe mortars at 0.35 / 0.5 / 0.65 onto circles, the first on
   Feza's spot), summons 2 nobetci at 66 % / 33 % with a little horn, neighs instead of roaring. Its TBC move is
   'berserkercharge' (Attumen: two telegraphed gallops across the arena forming a cross, BERSERK), and its arena surprise
   'sancak': at 60 % hp three tournament banners (EMODEL.sancak; they live in L.breakObjs with .banner while they stand, no
   loot) — all three knocked over → it is dizzy for SOV.dizzy s. He gallops all over his arena, so "Feza ran off" is
   counted from the arena's middle (kit.roam), and 'kapi' waits for his happy line (it never mentions the door). The town
   dings a far bell now and then (the kefir valley's moo). Balance: DIFF (test/r5_game_kid.html; mechanics, saves and
   every boss's surprises in test/r5_game_boss.html, r5_game_save.html, r5_game_tbc.html). */
